 <h3>How did I manage the useState</h3>
   To manage the useState I have used a react hook that return a current state and a function to update the state,
   initialy I just set a necesseary value for the state.Then as per my requirement I have pass the different state value as 
   props in different component and get back the specific value that I need, once I get the value then I just update 
   the state value using the function that update the state value.
